		<h1 class="center" style="margin-top: 10px;">Grow Your List has saved me <span id="counter">$</span> on my emails!</h1>
		<p class="center">(And my deliverability is way better!)</p>
		<h2 class="center">I'm open sourcing my email platform to disrupt the email as a service industry</h2>

		<h3>Imagine waking up to this email:</h3>

		<p><i>"On Monday, Jan. 14th, 2019, monthly Drip pricing will be increasing...</p>
		<p>At the moment your subscription is $2,634/mo. for up to 367,500 subscribers. This equates to be $31,608 per year.</p>
		<p>On the new pricing model, you would be at $4,193/mo. with up to 370,000 subscribers. <b>That's $50,316 per year...</b>"</i></p>

		<p>Drip gave me less than 2 weeks to decide, and I was livid because they already had serious outages - including one that caused virus warnings for all my MSN/Outlook customers! Little did they know I had been working on a custom email platform for the last 3 months, and this was the push I needed to launch.</p>

		<h2>Save outrageous amounts of money on your email list <u>and improve deliverability</u> with my free software!</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>I'm Jeremy, and I've been growing online businesses since 2008. I started in SEO, hated it, and eventually discovered the wonderful world of direct marketing and Conversion Rate Optimization</li>
			<li>I've built several very popular websites with millions of monthly users (the biggest has 363,000+ active and engaged email subscribers)</li>
			<li>I worked for <b>Conversion Rate Experts</b> from 2010-2015, and I'm not allowed to say anything else about my time there. <i>But you could always Google them to get the gist of what I did there ;)</i></li>
			<li>After spending more than $50,000 sending emails, I decided it was time to build my own email platform</li>
			<li><b>Fun fact:</b> In 2015 I manually <i>unsubscribed</i> more people from my list than most businesses get in their lifetime (637,226 to be exact) <i>because I couldn't afford to have a list that big :(</i></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Why give away something so valuable?</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>I think Email as a Service is a racket and providers charge an offensive amount of money, without having the exceptional service needed to justify their price.</li>
			<li>To fix this, I worked with an incredible developer to use Amazon's latest technology to deliver my emails simply and cheaply</li>
			<li>There's a lot of misconceptions about Amazon's deliverability: things have changed and unless you're sending spam your deliverability should improve.</li>
			<li>My monthly spend dropped from $4,193 to $360, and my deliverability actually went up!</li>
			<li>I already have a business, and I don't want to be tempted to get greedy like the rest of them</li>
